Plans for pyhton game:
Object oriented text-based adventure game
Maze generator?
Simple objects for rooms, moving between rooms removes a life, and the goal is to get to the end of the level.
Each room should have some kind of challenge, randomly generated.
the user can choose to bypass the challenge and lose a life, complete the challenge, but there is a timer, and for each minute or some length of time, the user loses a life.
The user would be rewarded 3 lifes if the user completes the challenge.

Perhaps this should be a maze. We can use the recrusive backtracking algorithm to generate it, and make it relatively hard for the user to fail. Perhaps we could have the map printed out somewhere for the user to view?
Nah.
For now, we will hard-code the maps. I assume that later if I want to expand on this, that we will make a map-generator...

So, probably read the map from a text-file.
A big grid, certain letters will stand for certain challenges.
We can have like S for start and F for finish.
Perhals H or W for the walls, having something to read this map should be easy as I've done it a couple times before...
