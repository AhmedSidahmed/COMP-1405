Text-based dungeon-crawler-like adventure game.
Basically a maze of rooms.
as you travel between rooms, your life points go away.

To traverse through certain rooms, one must play a challenge. These challenges get harder and different as you move along.

The game has a life-points system, as you move on you drain lifepoints, but you can also gain them as well.

The timing factor is mainly implemented as simple sleep timers between events.

To play the game, you must traverse between rooms by using the north/south/east/west commands.
Other commands:
help <- lists commands and what they do
map <- draws a map of the level
exit <- quits the game.
