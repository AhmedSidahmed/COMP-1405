The game is pretty simple.

Use the arrow keys to navigate the platforms. You get 100 points every second. For every frame you stand on the floor, you lose 100 points.
Don't spend a lot of time on the floor, jump as much as possible.
You can jump by tapping or holding down the up arrow key to hop.
you can change your velocity isntantly anywhere \0/ game is wayyyyy too hard otherwise.

didn't have time to sleep AND implement a jumping animation with a whole new animation system version that would let me add events to specific animations, letting the jump have a leani down animation first... Probably should have done this from the start, but it's too far in now :( <- probably should have added frame-relative timers as well, and maybe animation acceleration, but if I wanted to implement a 2D physics engine, I would have made a game centered around 2D physics. In this case, I wanted a platformer and couldn't think of an appropriate goal with the time I had, so I just went with this :)

you can pause the game by hitting Escape. Currently there is no Options menu as it would be cool, but rather pointless...

Writing this game was more about the potential game engine and practice with finite state machine stuff...
